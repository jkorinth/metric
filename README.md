metric - std::chrono-style distance units
=========================================

This header-only C++ library provides SI distance units (meters, millimeters,
kilometers, ...) in the style of the `std::chrono::duration` types. They
support standard arithmetic and relational operators, as well as unit mixing
with automatic compile-time type computation, and unit conversions.
